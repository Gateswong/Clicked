# Clicked

## Introduction

Clicked is a World of Warcraft addon that allows you to manage keybindings in an inuitive manner.

## Features

### Bind spells, items, and custom macros

Clicked has built-in functionality to bind spells, items, and custom macros. It allows you to pick a spell from the built-in spellbook so you don't have to type out spell names manually.

### Configure an unlimited amount of keybindings without requiring action bars

Clicked works in the background and does not require action bars to store spells and macros.

### Configure an unlimited amount of macros without the default /macro length limitations

Clicked does not use Blizzard's macros and thus does not suffer from the 255 character macro length limitation, or the limited amount of macros that can be saved per character.

### Dynamically load or unload keybinds based on specialization or combat state

Clicked will seamlessly switch between in-combat and out-of-combat configurations, allowing you to create archeology or fishing keybinds and immediately switch to combat keybinds when required.

### Specify a target per keybind

You can specify a target on a per-keybind basis without having to create macros. The available options are:

* Global - No target
* Player - Target yourself
* Target - Target your current target
* Mouseover - Target the current mouseover target
* Party[1-5] - Target a specific party member

### Change keybind behavior based on the target

You can configure a keybind to only activate if the specified target is hostile or friendly towards you.

* Always activate
* Only activate if the target is friendly
* Only activate if the target is hostile

## Upcoming Features

Clicked is still in active development and will gain the following features in the future:

* Support for left and right mouse button keybindings
* Support for a "mouseover (frame)" target to exclude targeting units from the 3D world
* Support to select an item from your bags or equipment panel

## Credits

Clicked is inspired by the [Clique](https://www.wowinterface.com/downloads/fileinfo.php?id=5108) addon. A lot of the click casting functionality is based of Clique.
